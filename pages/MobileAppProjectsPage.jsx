        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            The app was made using XML and Java in Android Studio. 
            Broadcast receiver, BottomNavigationView, Fragments, Timers and SQLite for database were used in the app making process.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            One of the greatest challenges in developing the app was setting up the database because 
            I had very little knowledge on how to do so but I eventually got it to work. Another challenge 
            I had was with removing and deleting recycler views, but after watching some online tutorials, I fully understood how it worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app's basic and important functions work, but it could still be improved upon. And I, as the developer of the app, learnt a lot while making it.
